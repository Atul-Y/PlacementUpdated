//difference between monotonic and bitonic array is that in monotonic array elements are either increasing or decreasing
//in bitonic array elements are first increasing and then decreasing
//for example: 1 3 8 12 4 2 is a bitonic array
//we have to find the maximum element in the bitonic array


//Maximum in Bitonic array = peak element in the array (greater than its adjacent elements) aldready solved in PeakInUnsorted.cpp

//Note in bitonic array first half is increasing and second half is decreasing whereas in peak element array no such condition is there
//also in bitonic array there is only one peak element whereas in peak element array there can be multiple peak elements
